                \item [(a)] Construct three different sequences $(x_n)$, $(y_n)$, and $(z_n)$, each of which converges to 1 without using the number 1 as a term in the sequence.
                
                    $(x_n) = 1 - \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \in N$ such that $n > 1$.

                    $(y_n) = 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for all $n \in N$ such that $n > 1$.

                    $(z_n) = 1 - \frac{1}{n^2}$ for all $n \in N$ such that $n > 1$.
                \item [(b)] Now, compute $\lim t(x_n)$, $\lim t(y_n)$, and $\lim t(z_n)$.
                
                    $\lim t(x_n) = \lim t(y_n) = \lim t(z_n) = 0$
                \item [(c)] Make an educated conjecture for $\lim_{x \to 1} t(x)$, and use Definition 4.2.1B to verify the claim. (Given $\epsilon > 0$, consider the set of points $\{x\in \bbR : t(x) \geq \epsilon\}$. Argue that all the points in this set are isolated.)
                
                    My conjecture is that $\lim_{x \to 1} t(x) = 0$.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $\epsilon > 0$.
                        Consider the set $T = \{x\in \bbR : t(x) \geq \epsilon\}$.
                        From the way $T$ is defined, we know that $x \in T$ means that either $x=0$ or $x=\frac{m}{n}$ in simplest form where $m,n \in \bbQ - \{0\}$ with $n>0$.
                        Since $x$ approaches 1 in our limit, $x \in T$ is of the latter form. 
                        So, $x = \frac{m}{n}$ which means $t(x) = \frac{1}{n} \geq \epsilon$ which simplifies to $n \leq \frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
                        Given some arbitrary finite interval $(0,a]$ where $a \in \bbR$, the set $T \cap (0,a]$ is also finite since there are only a finite amount of rational numbers $\frac{m}{n}$ with $n \leq \frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
                        Since this set is finite choose $\delta = \min{\{y : y \in T \cap (0,a]\}}$.
                        We can see that this choice of $\delta$ is correct because choosing $x \in V_\delta(1)$ means $x \notin T$ which means $t(x) \in V_\epsilon(0)$.
                    \end{proof}

        \item [4.2.5] 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item [(a)] Supply the details for how Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) follows from the sequential criterion for functional limits in Theorem 4.2.3 and the Algebraic Limit Theorem for sequences proved in Chapter 2.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions defined on the domain $A \subseteq \bbR$.
                        Assume $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$ for some limit point $c$ of $A$.
                        Then, we know from the Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits (Theorem 4.2.3) that for all sequences $(x_n) \subseteq A$ satisfying $x_n \neq c$ and $(x_n) \to c$, it follows that $f(x_n) \to L$ and $g(x_n) \to M$.
                        Then, using the algebraic limit theroem for sequences, we know that $f(x_n) + g(x_n) \to L+M$.
                        Thus, $\lim_{x \to c} [f(x) + g(x)] = L + M$ as desired.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(b)] Now, write another proof of Corollary 4.2.4 part (ii) directly from Definition 4.2.1 without using the sequential criterion in Theorem 4.2.3.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions defined on the domain $A \subseteq \bbR$.
                        Assume $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$ for some limit point $c$ of $A$.
                        Let $\epsilon > 0$.
                        Need to show that $\lim_{x \to c} [f(x) + g(x)] = L + M$, that is there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, it follows that $\abs{(f(x) + g(x)) - L - M} < \epsilon$.
                        Since $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, we know that there exists a $\delta_1>0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_1$, it follows that $\abs{f(x) - L} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$.
                        Similarly, since $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$, we know that there exists a $\delta_2>0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_2$, it follows that $\abs{g(x) - M} < \frac{\epsilon}{2}$.
                        So, choose $\delta$ such that $\delta = \min\{\delta_1, \delta_2\}$.
                        Then, whenever $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$:
                        \begin{align*}
                            \abs{(f(x) + g(x)) - (L + M)} &= \abs{(f(x) - L) + (g(x) - M)} \\
                            &\leq \abs{(f(x) - L)} + \abs{(g(x) - M)}\\
                            &< \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon.
                        \end{align*}
                        So, when $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, $\abs{(f(x) + g(x)) - (L + M)} < \epsilon$ as desired.
                    \end{proof}

                \item [(c)] Repeat (a) and (b) for Corollary 4.2.4 part (iii).
                        \begin{proof}
                            Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions defined on the domain $A \subseteq \bbR$.
                            Assume $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$ for some limit point $c$ of $A$.
                            Then, we know from the Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits (Theorem 4.2.3) that for all sequences $(x_n) \subseteq A$ satisfying $x_n \neq c$ and $(x_n) \to c$, it follows that $f(x_n) \to L$ and $g(x_n) \to M$.
                            Then, using the algebraic limit theroem for sequences, we know that $f(x_n) * g(x_n) \to LM$.
                            Thus, $\lim_{x \to c} [f(x)g(x)] = LM$ as desired.
                        \end{proof}

                        \begin{proof}
                            Suppose $f$ and $g$ are functions defined on the domain $A \subseteq \bbR$.
                            Assume $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$ and $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$ for some limit point $c$ of $A$.
                            Let $\epsilon > 0$.
                            Need to show that $\lim_{x \to c} [f(x)g(x)] = LM$, that is there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, it follows that $\abs{(f(x)g(x)) - LM} < \epsilon$.
                            Simplifying further, we need that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$,
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \abs{(f(x)g(x)) - LM} &= \abs{f(x)g(x) - Mf(x) + Mf(x) - LM} \\
                                    &\leq \abs{f(x)}\abs{(g(x)-M)} + \abs{M}\abs{(f(x) - L)} < \epsilon.
                                \end{align*}
                            Since $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L$, we know that there exists a $\delta_1>0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_1$, it follows that $\abs{f(x) - L} < \frac{\epsilon}{2M}$ where $M \neq 0$.
                            Since $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = M$, we know that there exists a $\delta_2>0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_2$, it follows that $\abs{g(x) - M} < \frac{\epsilon}{2(\abs{L}+1)}$.
                            Simplifying further, we need that there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$,
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \abs{(f(x)g(x)) - LM} &\leq \abs{f(x)}\abs{(g(x)-M)} + \abs{M}\abs{(f(x) - L)} \\
                                    &< \abs{f(x)}\frac{\epsilon}{2(\abs{L}+1)} + M\frac{\epsilon}{2M}
                                \end{align*}
                            So, we need to show $\abs{f(x)} \leq \abs{L} + 1$.
                            Well, $\abs{f(x)} = \abs{f(x) - L + L} \leq \abs{f(x) - L} + \abs{L}$.
                            Since $\abs{f(x) - L}$ can get arbitrarily small, we know that there exists a $\delta_3 >0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_3$, it follows that $\abs{f(x) - L} < 1$.
                            So, $\abs{f(x) - L} + \abs{L} \leq 1 + \abs{L}$ which means $\abs{f(x)} \leq \abs{L} + 1$.
                            Now choose $\delta = \min{\{\delta_1, \delta_2, \delta_3\}}$.
                            Then, we have that
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \abs{(f(x)g(x)) - LM} &< \abs{f(x)}\frac{\epsilon}{2(\abs{L}+1)} + M\frac{\epsilon}{2M}\\
                                    &< (\abs{L}+1)\frac{\epsilon}{2(\abs{L}+1)} + M\frac{\epsilon}{2M}\\
                                    &= \frac{\epsilon}{2} + \frac{\epsilon}{2} = \epsilon
                                \end{align*}
                            whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x - c} < \delta$ and $M \neq 0$.
                            So, $\lim_{x \to c} [f(x)g(x)] = LM$.
                        \end{proof}
            \end{itemize}
        \item [4.2.6] Let $g : A \to \bbR$ and assume that $f$ is a bounded function on $A \subseteq \bbR$ (i.e., there exists $M > 0$ satisfying $\abs{f(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in A$). Show that if $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$, then $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)f(x) = 0$ as well.
            \begin{proof}
                Suppose $\epsilon > 0$.
                Need to show $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)f(x) = 0$, that is $\exists \delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, $\abs{f(x)g(x)} < \epsilon$.
                $\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0$ means that there exists $\delta_1>0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta_1$, $\abs{g(x)} < \frac{\epsilon}{M}$.
                Choose $\delta = \delta_1$.
                Then, since $\abs{f(x)} \leq M$ for all $x \in A$, we have that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, $\abs{f(x)g(x)} < M *\frac{\epsilon}{M} = \epsilon$.
                Thus, $\lim_{x \to c} g(x)f(x) = 0$ as desired.
            \end{proof}
        \item [4.2.7] 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item [(a)] The statement $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2} = \infty$ certainly makes intuitive sense. Construct a rigorous definition in the “challenge–response” style of Definition 4.2.1 for a limit statement of the form $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \infty$ and use it to prove the previous statement.

                    Definition: Let $f : A \to \bbR$. We say that $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \infty$ provided that, for all $N > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} < \delta$, it follows that $f(x) > N$. 
                    
                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $N > 0$.
                        Need that there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x-c} = \abs{x} < \delta$, it follows that $f(x) > N$.
                        Choose $\delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt(N)}$.
                        Then, whenever $x \in A$ and $0 < \abs{x} < \delta = \frac{1}{\sqrt(N)}$, it follows that $x^2 <  \frac{1}{N}$.
                        Thus, $\frac{1}{x^2} = f(x) > N$ as desired.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(b)] Now, construct a definition for the statement $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L$. Show $\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{1}{x} = 0$.
                    
                    Definition: Let $f : A \to \bbR$. We say that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L$ provided that, for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $D > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D$, it follows that $\abs{f(x) - L} < \epsilon$. 

                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $\epsilon > 0$.
                        Need that there exists a $D > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D$, it follows that $\abs{\frac{1}{x} - 0} < \epsilon$. 
                        Choose $D = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
                        Then, whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$, it follows that $\abs{\frac{1}{x}} < \abs{\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}} = \abs{\epsilon} = \epsilon$.
                        Thus, $\abs{\frac{1}{x}} < \epsilon$ as desired.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(c)] What would a rigorous definition for $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty$ look like? Give an example of such a limit.
                
                    Definition: Let $f : A \to \bbR$. We say that $\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \infty$ provided that, for all $N > 0$, there exists a $D > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D$, it follows that $f(x) > N$.

                    An example of such a limit would be $f(x) = x$ because $\lim_{x\to\infty} x = \infty$.

                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $N > 0$.
                        Need that there exists a $D > 0$ such that whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D$, it follows that $f(x) = x > N$.
                        Choose $D = N$.
                        Then, whenever $x \in A$ and $x > D$, it follows that $x > N$ as desired.

        \item [4.2.8] Assume $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x$ in some set $A$ on which $f$ and $g$ are defined. Show that for any limit point $c$ of $A$ we must have $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \geq \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$.
            \begin{proof}
                Assume $f(x) \geq g(x)$ for all $x$ in some set $A$ on which $f$ and $g$ are defined.
                Need to show that for any limit point $c$ of $A$, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \geq \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$.
                Suppose $c$ is any limit point of $A$.
                Let $ L = \lim_{x \to c} f(x)$ and $M = \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$.
                Then, we know from the Sequential Criterion for Functional Limits (Theorem 4.2.3) that for all sequences $(x_n) \subseteq A$ satisfying $x_n \neq c$ and $(x_n) \to c$, it follows that $f(x_n) \to L$ and $g(x_n) \to M$.
                We know that $f(x_n) \geq g(x_n)$ and so by the Order Limit Theorem we have that $\lim f(x_n) = L \geq \lim g(x_n) = M$.
                So, $\lim_{x \to c} f(x) \geq \lim_{x \to c} g(x)$ as desired.

                \item [(a)] Supply a proof for Theorem 4.3.9 using the $\epsilon / \delta$ characterization of continuity.
                    
                    Theorem 4.3.9: Given $f:A\to\bbR$ and $g:B\to\bbR$, assume that the range $f(A) = \{f(x): x \in A\}$ is contained in the domain $B$ so that the composition $g \circ f(x) = g(f(x))$ is well-defined on $A$.

                    If $f$ is continuous at $c \in A$, and if $g$ is continuous at $f(c) \in B$, then $g \circ f$ is continuous at $c$.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Suppose $\epsilon > 0$ is arbitrary.
                        Since $g$ is continuous at $f(c) \in B$, there exists a $\delta_1>0$ such that $\abs{g(f(x))-g(f(c))} < \epsilon$ whenever $\abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \delta_1$ (and $x \in A$ and $f(x) \in B$).
                        Since $f$ is continuous at $c \in A$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \delta_1$ whenever $\abs{x-c} < \delta$ (and $x \in A$).
                        Combining both of the above parts, we see that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that $\abs{x-c} < \delta$ implies $\abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \delta_1$ which implies $\abs{g(f(x))-g(f(c))} < \epsilon$.
                        Thus, by definition of continuity, $g \circ f$ is continuous at $c$.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(b)] Give another proof of this theorem using the sequential characterization of continuity (from Theorem 4.3.2 (iv)).
                    \begin{proof}
                        Assume that $(x_n) \to c$ (with $x_n \in A$).
                        Since $f$ is continuous at $c$, $f(x_n) \to f(c)$ by Theorem 4.3.2 (iv) (Characterizations of Continuity).
                        Since $g$ is continuous at $f(c)$, $g(f(x_n)) \to g(f(c))$ by Theorem 4.3.2 (iv).
                        Thus, by Theorem 4.3.2 (iv), $g \circ f$ is continuous at $c$.
                    \end{proof}

                \item [(a)] Show using Definition 4.3.1 that any function $f$ with domain $\bbZ$ will necessarily be continuous at every point in its domain.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Need to show that for all $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $\abs{x-c} < \delta$ (and $x \in A$ and $c\in A$) it follows that $\abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \epsilon$.
                        Suppose $\epsilon > 0$ and $c \in A$ is arbitrary.
                        Choose $\delta = 1$.
                        Then, we see that whenever $\abs{x-c} < \delta$ (and $x \in A$ and $c\in A$), it follows that $\abs{f(x) - f(c)} < \epsilon$.
                        So, any function $f$ with domain $\bbZ$ will necessarily be continuous at every point in $\bbZ$.

                \item [(b)] Show in general that if $c$ is an isolated point of $A \subseteq \bbR$, then $f : A \to \bbR$ is continuous at $c$.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Assume $c$ is an isolated point of $A \subseteq \bbR$.
                        Need to show that $f : A \to \bbR$ is continuous at $c$, that is for all $V_\epsilon(f(c))$, there exists a $V_\delta(c)$ with the property that $x \in V_\delta(c)$ (and $x \in A$) implies $f(x) \in V_\epsilon(f(c))$.
                        Suppose $\epsilon > 0$ is arbitrary.
                        Since $c$ is an isolated point, we know from the inverse of Definition 3.2.4 that there exists a $\delta$ neighborhood $V_\delta(c)$ that intersects $A$ only at the point $c$, so $V_\delta(c) \cap A = c$.
                        Then, for all $x \in V_\delta(c)$, $x = c$ which means that $f(x) = f(c)$.
                        So, $f(x) \in V_\epsilon(f(c))$.
                        Thus, $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$ by Theorem 4.3.2 (iii).

        \item [4.3.6] 
            \begin{itemize}
                \item [(a)] Referring to the proper theorems, give a formal argument that Dirichlet’s function from Section 4.1 is nowhere-continuous on $\bbR$.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Let Dirichlet’s function be defined as follows:
                        \(
                            g(x) = 
                            \begin{cases}
                                1 \text{ if } x \in \bbQ \\
                                0 \text{ if } x \notin \bbQ.
                            \end{cases}
                        \)
                        Need to show that $g$ is nowhere-continuous -- that is it is not continuous at any point in $\bbR$.

                        First, choose $q\in\bbQ$ arbitrarily.
                        We know that $q \in \bbR$ and $\bbI$ is dense in $\bbR$ which means that there must exist a sequence $(x_n) \subseteq \bbI$ such that $(x_n) \to q$.
                        Then, for all $n \in \bbN$, $g(x_n) = 0$ which means $\lim g(x_n) = 0$, but $g(q) = 1$.
                        Since $\lim g(x_n) \neq g(q)$, we see that $g$ is not continuous at $q$ by Corollary 4.3.3 (Criterion for Discontinuity).

                        Next, choose $i \in \bbI$ arbitrarily.
                        We know that $i \in \bbR$ and $\bbQ$ is dense in $\bbR$ which means that there must exist a sequence $(y_n) \subseteq \bbQ$ such that $(y_n) \to i$.
                        Then, for all $n \in \bbN$, $g(y_n) = 1$ which means $\lim g(y_n) = 1$, but $g(i) = 0$.
                        Since $\lim g(y_n) \neq g(i)$, we see that $g$ is not continuous at $i$ by Corollary 4.3.3 (Criterion for Discontinuity).
                        
                        Since $\bbR$ consists of points from $\bbQ$ and $\bbI$, we see that $\bbR$ is nowhere-continuous.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(b)] Review the definition of Thomae’s function in Section 4.1 and demonstrate that it fails to be continuous at every rational point.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Let Thomae’s function be defined as follows:
                        \[ t(x) =
                        \begin{cases}
                            1 & \text{if } x = 0\\
                            \frac{1}{n} & \text{if } x = \frac{m}{n} \in \bbQ - \{0\} \text{ is in lowest terms with } n > 0\\
                            0 & \text{if } x \notin \bbQ.
                        \end{cases}
                        \]
                        Arbitrarily choose $m,n \in \bbZ$ such that $n\neq 0$.
                        Need to show that $t$ is not continuous at $\frac{m}{n}$. 
                        Since $\frac{m}{n} \in \bbR$ and $\bbI$ is dense in $\bbR$, there must exist a sequence $(x_n) \subseteq \bbI$ such that $(x_n) \to \frac{m}{n}$.
                        Then, for all $n \in \bbN$, $t(x_n) = 0$ which means $\lim t(x_n) = 0$, but $t(\frac{m}{n}) = \frac{1}{n}$.
                        Since $\lim t(x_n) \neq t(\frac{m}{n})$, we see that $t$ is not continuous at $\frac{m}{n}$ by Corollary 4.3.3 (Criterion for Discontinuity).
                        Since $m,n$ were arbitrarily chosen and every $x \in \bbQ$ can be represented as $\frac{a}{b}$ for some $a,b \in \bbZ$ where $b \neq 0$, we see that $t$ is not continuous at any point in $\bbQ$.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(c)] Use the characterization of continuity in Theorem 4.3.2 (iii) to show that Thomae’s function is continuous at every irrational point in $\bbR$. (Given $\epsilon > 0$, consider the set of points $\{x \in \bbR : t(x) \geq \epsilon\}$. Argue that all the points in this set are isolated.)
                    \begin{proof}
                        Choose $i \in \bbI$ arbitrarily.
                        Need to show that for all $V_\epsilon(t(i))$, there exists a $V_\delta(i)$ such that $v \in V_\delta(i)$ implies $t(v) \in V_\epsilon(t(i))$.
                        Choose $\epsilon > 0$ arbitrarily.
                        Let $T = \{x \in \bbR : t(x) \geq \epsilon\}$.
                        Then, for all $x\in T$, $x \in \bbQ$ so $\exists m,n \in \bbZ$ such that $x = \frac{m}{n}$ and $0 < n \leq \frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
                        Then, if we look at some fixed interval around $i$ like $[i-1, i+1]$, we can see that $T \cap [i-1, i+1]$ is finite since there are only a finite amount of rational numbers within this interval with a denominator less than $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.
                        Since $T \cap [i-1, i+1]$ is finite, we can choose $\delta > 0$ such that for all $v \in V_\delta(i)$, $v \notin T$ which means that $t(v) \in V_\epsilon(t(i))$.
                        Thus, $t$ is continuous at every irrational point by Theorem 4.3.2 (iii).

            \begin{itemize}
                \item [(a)] Show that if a function is continuous on all of $\bbR$ and equal to 0 at every rational point, then it must be identically 0 on all of $\bbR$.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Assume a function $f$ is continuous on all of $\bbR$ and equal to 0 at every rational point.
                        Since $f$ is 0 at every rational point, we only need to show that $f$ is 0 on every irrational point in $\bbR$.
                        Choose $i\in\bbI$ arbitrarily.
                        Since $\bbQ$ is dense in $\bbR$, we know that there exists a sequence $(x_n) \subseteq \bbQ$ such that $(x_n)\to i$.
                        Then, since $f$ is continuous on $\bbR$, we have that $0 = \lim f(x_n) = f(i)$.
                        So, $f$ is 0 on every irrational point in $\bbR$.
                        Thus, $f$ is 0 on all of $\bbR$.
                    \end{proof}
                \item [(b)] If $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\bbR$ and $f(r) = g(r)$ at every rational point, must $f$ and $g$ be the same function?
                    \begin{proof}
                        No, take the following counterexample:

                        \(
                            f(x) = 
                            \begin{cases}
                                0 \text{ if } x \in \bbQ \\
                                1 \text{ if } x \notin \bbQ
                            \end{cases}
                            \\
                            g(x) = 
                            \begin{cases}
                                0 \text{ if } x \in \bbQ \\
                                2 \text{ if } x \notin \bbQ
                            \end{cases}
                        \)

                        So, $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\bbR$ and $f(r) = g(r)$ at every rational point $r$.
                        However, $f$ and $g$ are not the same function.

        \item [4.3.9] (Contraction Mapping Theorem). Let $f$ be a function defined on all of $\bbR$, and assume there is a constant $c$ such that $0 < c < 1$ and $\abs{f(x) - f(y)} \leq c\abs{x-y}$ for all $x, y \in \bbR$.
            \begin{itemize}
                \item [(a)] Show that $f$ is continuous on $\bbR$.

                        Choose $\epsilon > 0$ and $y \in \bbR$ arbitrarily.
                        Need to show that $\exists \delta > 0$ such that $\abs{x - y} < \delta$ and $x \in \bbR$ implies that $\abs{f(x) - f(y)} < \epsilon$.
                        Choose $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{c}$.
                        Then, $\abs{x - y} < \delta = \frac{\epsilon}{c}$ means that $c\abs{x-y} < \epsilon$.
                        So, $\abs{f(x) - f(y)} \leq c\abs{x-y} < \epsilon$.
                        Thus, $f$ is continuous on $\bbR$ by Theorem 4.3.1.

                    \begin{proof}
                        Choose $y_1 \in \bbR$ arbitrarily.
                        Let $(y_n)$ be the sequence $(y_1, f(y_1), f(f(y_1)), ...)$.
                        Given an arbitrary $x \in \bbN$, we know from part a that $\abs{y_{x+1} - y_{x+2}} = \abs{f(y_{x}) - f(y_{x+1})} \leq c\abs{y_x - y_{x+1}} \leq c^2\abs{y_{x-1} - y_{x}} \leq ... \leq c^x\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}}$ where $0<c<1$.
                        Given arbitrary $i,j \in \bbN$ such that $i < j$, we know from the previous fact that $\abs{y_i - y_j} \leq \abs{y_i - y_{i+1}} + \abs{y_{i+1} - y_{i+2}} + ... + \abs{y_{j-1} - y_j} \leq c^{i-1}\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}} + c^i\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}} + ... + c^{j-2}\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}} = c^{i-1}\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}}(1 + c + ... + c^{j-i-1}) < c^{i-1}\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}}(\frac{1}{1-c})$.
                        Need to show that $(y_n)$ is a cauchy sequence -- that is for every $\epsilon > 0$ there exists an $N \in \bbN$ such that whenever $m,n \geq N$ with $m < n$ it follows that $\abs{y_m - y_n} = c^{m-1}\abs{y_{1} - y_{2}}(\frac{1}{1-c}) < \epsilon$.
                        Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary.
                        Choose $N \in \bbN$ such that $c^{N-1} < \frac{\epsilon(1-c)}{\abs{y_1 - y_2}}$.
                        Then, as shown above, whenever $m,n \geq N$ with $m < n$ it follows that $\abs{y_m - y_n} < \epsilon$ which satisfies that $(y_n)$ is a Cauchy Sequence.

                \item [(c)] Prove that $y$ is a fixed point of $f$ (i.e., $f(y) = y$) and that it is unique in this regard.
                    \begin{proof}
                        Let $y = \lim y_n$.
                        Then, since $f$ is continuous, $f(y) = \lim f(y_n)$.
                        Since $f(y_n) = y_{n+1}$, $f(y) = \lim y_{n+1}$.
                        Similarly, $y_n = f(y)$.
                        So, by transitivity, $y = \lim y_n = \lim y_{n+1}$.
                        Thus, since $f(y) = \lim y_{n+1}$, we have that $y = f(y)$.

                    \begin{proof}
                        Assume $x$ is any arbitrary point in $\bbR$.
                        We know from part b that the sequence $(x, f(x), f(f(x)), ...)$ must converge to some limit $l$.
                        We also know from part c that $l$ must be a fixed point of $f$.
                        So, we have that both $l$ and $y$ are fixed points.
                        Then, they must satisfy $\abs{f(l) - f(y)} = \abs{l - y}$ and $\abs{f(l) - f(y)} \leq c\abs{l - y}$ for $0<c<1$.
                        The only way that both statements are satisfied is if $l = y$.
                        Thus, the sequence $(x, f(x), f(f(x)), ...)$ converges to $y$ defined in (b).
